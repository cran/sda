              CHANGES IN `sda' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.0


This package implements LDA and DDA classification,
where the training of the classifier is done via Stein-type
shrinkage of frequencies, variances, and correlation.

This approach is particularly suitable for high-dimensional 
classification.


This is the first public release (27 October 2008).
