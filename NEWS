              RELEASE HISTORY OF THE "sda" PACKAGE
            ========================================


              CHANGES IN `sda' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.1 

- new centroids() function to compute group-wise centroids,
  (pooled variances), and inverse pooled correlations. 
- uses the "collapse" option in corpcor >= 1.4.8 to save
  memory when estimated correlation is diagonal (effectively
  turning LDA into DDA if the estimated shrinkage intensity lambda=1).


              CHANGES IN `sda' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.0


This package implements LDA and DDA classification,
where the training of the classifier is done via Stein-type
shrinkage of frequencies, variances, and correlation.

This approach is particularly suitable for high-dimensional 
classification.


This is the first public release (27 October 2008).
